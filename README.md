# Concurrent-In-Memory-Key-Value-Store-
This project implements an in-memory key-value store supporting concurrent operations, ensuring data consistency and efficiency. Features include put, get, and delete operations, with synchronization for safe multithreading. An optional feature adds lossless compression. A testbench evaluates performance under varied conditions.
